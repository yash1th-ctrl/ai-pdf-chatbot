Short stories
INTRODUCTION
A short story is a prose narrative of limited length.
It organises the action and thoughts of its
characters into the pattern of a plot. The plot
form may be comic, tragic, romantic or satiric.
The central incident is selected to manifest, as
much as possible, the protagonist's life and
character, and the details contribute to the
development of the plot.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez was brought up by his
grandparents in Northern Columbia because his
parents were poor and struggling. A novelist, short-
story writer and journalist, he is widely considered
the greatest living Latin American master of narrative.
Marquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.
His two masterpieces are One Hundred Years in
Solitude (1967, tr. 1970) and Love in The Time of
Cholera (1985, tr. 1988). His themes are violence,
solitude and the overwhelming human need for love.
This story reflects, like most of his works, a high
point in Latin American magical realism; it is rich
and lucid, mixing reality with fantasy.

One morning at nine o'clock, while we were having breakfast
on the terrace of the Havana Riviera Hotel under a bright
sun, a huge wave picked up several cars that were driving
down the avenue along the seawall or parked on the
pavement, and embedded one of them in the side of the
hotel. It was like an explosion of dynamite that sowed panic
on all twenty floors of the building and turned the great
entrance window to dust.`;
