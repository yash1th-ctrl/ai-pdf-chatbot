## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Upload Fails:**
```bash
# Check file size:
Get-ItemProperty "C:\Users\Yashwanth Peralta\OneDrive\Desktop\samp.pdf" | Select-Object Length

# If over 5MB, compress or use a different PDF
```

### **Processing Fails:**
- **Check console** for specific error messages
- **Verify PDF is text-based** (not scanned images)
- **Try opening PDF** in browser to ensure it's not corrupted

### **No AI Response:**
- **Check System Status** in dashboard
- **Verify Gemini API** is working (run Service Tester)
- **Wait 30 seconds** after upload before testing chat

### **Generic Responses:**
- **Check vector embeddings** were created successfully
- **Try more specific questions** about your PDF content
- **Verify fileId** matches between upload and chat
